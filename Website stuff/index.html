<h1>Hat Scribe</h1>
<h3>EECS 493 Winter 2014</h3>
<h3>Vicki Li - Daniel Nees - John Rabideau</h3>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Hat Scribe is an interactive drafting tool intended to motivate users to write more by gamifying the writing process. This tool was designed by Team Mad Milliners for EECS 493, the User Interface course at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p class="br"></p>
<p>Users will utilize this tool by writing a document in the text editor. As they write, users will be rewarded with items such as experience points, stars, and, most importantly, HATS! Experience points are used to level up a user's avatar; the more they write, the more experience they gain, and their avatar will reach higher levels. Hats are items that can be used to customize a user's avatar. At first, a user is only allowed to place one hat on their avatar, but as they reach higher levels, the use is allowed to stack multiple hats atop their avatar's head. Lastly, stars are items that allow the user to take a short break from their writing. They can be spent in a slot machine that can give the user any aforementioned item. Once the user runs out of stars, the user will need to work on the document some more before they can take another break. Any time an event happens in the application, such as levelling up or receiving a hat, the user is notified in a notifications bar present on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p class="br"></p>
<p>In the bottom left corner, there's a button that will take the user to the inventory screen. This screen is where the user is allowed to customize their avatar with hats. A collection of the user's hats is displayed, and to change the hats the avatar is wearing, the user drags and drops the hat onto the avatar. The user can then close the inventory screen and continue working, their new hat sitting proudly atop their avatar.</p>
<p class="br"></p>
<p>While this tool does not contain the styling options present in programs such as Google Docs or Microsoft Word, there are some tools present that can help the user. Users can load in a .txt file and the text editor will allow them to continue where they left off. When users are working on a document, they are allowed to set a goal for the document, such as 200 words or 5 paragraphs. If the user is able to reach that goal, they will be given an extra reward. The user's current progress on the goal, as well as the goal itself, will be tracked while the user is working on the document.</p>
